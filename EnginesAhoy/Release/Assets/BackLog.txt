Figure out solutions:

Inheritance for animations and rigidbody
	- Currently in character. Move up or down? Objects maybe
	- 3D and 2D objects?
		- Need implementation for other dependencies in 3D

Remove SDL?
	- Should be done before moving too far forward
	- Reimplement all SDL calls with C++

Why use SDL?
	- Reviews are bad
	- Image functions not thread safe (supposedly), and thread safety is important

Pending work (before 3D):
	- Maps, Layers
		- Editor
		- Parser
	- Camera and Viewport
	- UI
		- Object Management
		- Map and tiles
		- Camera and viewport
		- 
	- Collision 2D
	- States
		- Player States
		- Game States
